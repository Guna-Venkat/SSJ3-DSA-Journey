# 🧠 SSJ3-DSA-Journey 🚀

**A 20-Day Pre-IITK Challenge** to master core Data Structures & Algorithms before starting my MTech journey at IIT Kanpur. This is my focused sprint — like Goku training in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber — to reach my ultimate coding form.

---

## 🗓️ Goal
To complete 60% of the most essential DSA topics using:
- 📘 *Elements of Programming Interviews (EPI)* problems
- 💻 LeetCode problems for pattern-based mastery
- 🧾 Daily journal logs
- 📒 Quick topic notes & concept summaries
